As you contemplate the intricacies of this password management program, imagine the vast network of interconnected websites, each requiring its own unique password for access. With so many passwords to remember, it can be overwhelming to keep track of them all. This program offers a solution, providing users with the ability to securely store their passwords in a centralized location.

As you consider the options presented by the program, take a moment to reflect on the power of technology to simplify our lives. With just a few clicks, users can generate a new, randomly generated password for a website, ensuring that their online accounts remain secure. And with the ability to retrieve saved passwords for previously added websites, users can rest assured that they will never be locked out of their accounts due to forgotten login information.

But as you delve deeper into the inner workings of the program, consider the potential risks of storing sensitive information in the cloud. While the use of a service account and the google-auth library offer a layer of security, it is important to remain vigilant and take steps to protect your personal data.

In a world where technology is rapidly advancing, it is up to each individual to take responsibility for their online security. By utilizing tools such as this password management program, we can stay one step ahead of cyber threats and safeguard our digital identities. So login, create a new user, and start creating your passwords – the power is in your hands!

## Story Development 
  
### **1. Characters**  
The first thing I have done is finding my character. This is important as a story developer to visualise them in situations whilst I build up the story. Canva provided me with character designs featuring various poses and actions. I carefully selected designs that matched in appearance for the fox. Unfortunately, there were fewer options available for the cat in comparison, so I utilized similar cat designs and primarily used black and white colors to maintain a cohesive aesthetic between the two characters.

![Paddington](assets/images/Paddington.png) 

One of my favorite characters of all time is Paddington, created by Michael Bond. Initially from the jungle, Paddington later finds himself exploring the city. In my case, I have switched things around because the colors of the fox reminded me of Paddington, and since a fox is more likely to prefer living in nature, I thought it would be fitting to have a cat as the city-dwelling character.

![Marshmallow](assets/images/marshmallow.png)

The reason I gave the cat the name Marshmallow was because to me, it resembled a marshmallow.

### **2. Locations & Objects**  

After that, I selected the necessary location and objects for the scene. As a story developer, this step is crucial for me to envision the story as I construct it.

![City](assets/images/locations2.svg)

### **3. World Building**  

Through mind mapping, I was able to create a world-building framework for both paths in my game. Each scene seamlessly transitions into the next, creating a guide to the overall direction of the game. By visualising this framework on Figma, I was able to analyze the story from a more organised perspective and refine the paths to further develop the narrative.

![Worldbuilding](assets/images/worldbuilding.png)

### **4. Story Structure for JavaScript**  

This code updates and manipulates the content of an HTML page based on user interaction. It gets references to various HTML elements using the document.getElementById() method and adds event listeners to buttons using the addEventListener() method. When a button is clicked, the updateScene() function is called with a destination parameter based on the user's choice. The function retrieves a corresponding object from the scenes array based on the sceneName parameter, updates the HTML elements' content using the object's properties, sets the src attribute of the picture element based on the sceneName, removes the event listeners from the buttons, and adds new ones based on the updated choices array. The code loads the initial scene by calling updateScene() with the sceneName parameter of 'start.'

The game is designed to keep the user engaged by creating a loop that encourages them to explore different options and reconsider their choices. It does not have a definite endpoint, as users are prompted to try different paths or revisit previous scenes. This design fosters continuous interaction with the game and encourages users to explore all available options.

## Wireframes

Using Figma, I crafted the wireframes both desktop and mobile. Initially, I was unaware that the background would be in video format. however, the design helped me in envisioning the page's appearance, enabling me to experiment with various text fonts, sizes, and weights. This allowed me to style in CSS with ease after visualizing its look and feel.

## Design & Media

### **Brand**  

I have chosen to go ahead with a text logo for the following reasons: 

1. Flexibility: Text logos are generally more flexible than image-based logos since they can be easily scaled up or down and used in a variety of contexts.

2. Simplicity: Text logos are often simpler and more straightforward than image-based logos, which can make them more memorable and easier to recognize. They can also be more versatile, allowing for variations in font, color, and style.

3. Clarity: Text logos can be more clear and legible than image-based logos, particularly when the logo needs to be displayed at a small size or in a low-resolution format. This can ensure that the logo is always visible and recognizable, even in challenging circumstances.


### **Colour Palette**

Despite using a video for the background, I primarily centered the color palette around blue since it is associated with both nature and technology. White was chosen for the text to ensure readability, as black would have been difficult to see against the video. The colours shown below are an approximate blend of the hues present in the video.

![colour](assets/images/palette.svg) 

 

### **Typography**

I used Google Fonts for my website, taking advantage of its vast library of 1,493 open source font families. Here are the chosen fonts for this project: 

![VT323](assets/images/vt323.PNG)

1. [VT323, by Peter Hull](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323) was used due its legibility, retro style, and ease of use.

![Quciksand](assets/images/Quicksand.PNG)

2. [Quicksand, Designed by Andrew Paglinawan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) was used due it's modern and friendly appearance, making it suitable for a wide range of audience. It is also highly legible, making it easy for players to read instructions and text within the game.

### **Artwork & Video**
As a Canva Pro user, I was able to access a wide variety of additional features and resources, including a vast library of licensed images, videos graphics, and templates that could be used without infringing on copyright laws. Drawing on my photography and design skills, I used these resources to create unique and visually striking artwork for this project. Whereas the video I used was included within Canva's library.

The multiplayer mode could also include features such as chat or voice communication, leaderboards, and rewards for cooperative play. This could enhance the social aspect of the game and provide an additional layer of engagement for players.

 <br>

 - Customisation: This could allow players to customise their character's appearance and clothing, as well as the environment in which the game takes place. For example, players could choose different outfits that reflect their personal style or select different backgrounds or landscapes that suit their preferences. This could enhance the game's replayability and allow players to create a more personalised experience.

 <br>

### **Javascript Validation using JSHint** 

![screenshot of JSHint validation](assets/images/JS.PNG)

   
### **Bugs & Fixes**  
 1. To ensure that the video does not overlap with the navigation and footer elements, I styled in CSS to create separate containers for each of them and bring them forward in the layout and ensure it's responsive across all devices. 

 2. To address the issue of the text overlapping the video and the white footer appearing, I implemented a solution by designing a video container that fits the entire frame. Additionally, I created a separate container that consolidates the title, context, and image. This allows users to scroll through this section without encountering the problem of the page being cut off and leaving a white footer.

 3. Initially, the audio on my website played automatically as soon as the user entered the site, without giving them any control over it. To address this issue, I used JavaScript to create functions that enable the user to turn the sound on and off at their discretion by simply pressing a button.

### **Unsolved Bugs** 
 
1. Even though I was able to come up with an alternative solution for the video to fill the page, my initial intention was to have the video stretch across the page and expand, which would have eliminated the need for a scroll-down feature for the main body section.

2. Although I found the strong scroll bar on the page disruptive to the design, I was unable to style it as I wanted. As a compromise, I decided to hide the scroll bar while keeping its functionality intact. However, this solution poses a potential problem as it may confuse users into thinking the page is static and that they cannot scroll through it.

3. In Javascript, I wasn't able to add the picture value within the rest (title, context , choices and destination). I had to separate it or it would not work for me.

4. The images takes longer time to load and if the  game is played quickly, it can freeze and crash. 

### **Feedback from testers**  

1. After sharing and testing the link with some friends, they pointed out some errors in the story's destination when clicked. As a result, I was able to correct the errors and update the story's text to make it more relevant.

2. The website game may crash if played too quickly. However, since it is a narrative-based game, the user is compelled to take their time and cannot rush to click the next page, which helps to prevent crashes.

3. Not being able to control the volume when played
